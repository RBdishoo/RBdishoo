I am currently studying computer science at Arizona State University and have a growing passion for cybersecurity and AI. 

## Objective

The exponential rise of AI has transformed cybersecurity into a dynamic frontier, a reality I grasped early in my Computer Science studies. My ambition is to be at the forefront of this evolution, architecting AI-powered defenses that actively counteract sophisticated, AI-enhanced threats to protect user and enterprise data.
